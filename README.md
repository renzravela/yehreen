# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Renz Aerol Ravela

I'm a self-taught full-stack web developer with a passion for building intuitive and efficient digital experiences. Whether it's websites, applications, or tools, I love turning complex ideas into user-friendly, practical products that make a real difference.

Over the years, I've gained hands-on experience as both a freelancer and a full-stack developer, working with modern technologies such as:

- **TypeScript**, **React**, **Next.js**, **Vue**, **Svelte**
- **Node.js** (Express, Fastify)
- **PHP** (Laravel, CodeIgniter)
- **Python** (Flask)
- **Prisma**, **MongoDB**, **SQL**
- **WordPress** (including custom plugins)

I've contributed to a wide range of projects, including mobile applications, web platforms, Chrome extensions, and custom WordPress solutions. I'm always eager to learn and continuously strive to improve my skills to deliver scalable, reliable, and user-focused solutions.

Let's build something great together!
